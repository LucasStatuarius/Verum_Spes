"Scelus Urba" is a game which is created for the players who like the text-based, MMO, 
rich in lore, simple to learn and challenging to master games.

The game's action is set in the city called "Strati via igni" and this world's year is 2074 (50 years after our times).
This city as it might be shown in other futuristic games is full of cybernetics, modern mafias called "enterprises",
"the government", "hordes" and above them all "THE NEW ORDER LODGE" which is the freemasonry foundation whose primal
goal is to advance the humankind via technological advancement. Although they declare that they want the good of the
humankind their actions result in making people poorer and less happier. 

You will see the seemingly bottomless darkness this city emanates wherever you go and whoever you meet. 
Corpses of starved people lie on the slum streets, woman and men because of the hopeless situation sell themselves as a 
corporative slave who works to death without time to take care to raise the children. 
Schools don't teach you as a kid anything at all leaving you with wasted years. In the city's corners girls
are being brutally raped and killed if bandits are "bored", cunning girls bring naive boys with luring seduction to make
another drama for "lawful" compensations via court making them ultimately suicidal. Enterprises are desperate to work their 
workers to death just to survive another month. the government puts more and more laws to confuse the intellectuals 
for more benefits to TNO Lodge and its subjects working in a scope from the baby care business to the most brutal jobs 
of mutilating people, selling people, slaughtering "unwanted" ones, enslaving the very minds of masses through everything possible,
owning and running mafia clubs, executing the debts of unrepayable debtors by not only claiming the property but also
by forcing slavery upon them. The list of crimes and atrocities are too long to be mentioned.

It's estimated that this city's population is around 33 000 000 people according to the government's registration of citizens.
That's most likely false, since people are lost, killed and kidnapped so that the data might have long-dead people considered
as yet alive.
The addition of the lack of forces to recruit for the establishment in order to count the slum district's
population which makes near 27% of the city's territory. 
Other than that the establishment enforces to strictly monitor the working class population which lives in the factory district's 
rented low-end apartments and that zone is covering around 43% of the city's area, 
The market district in the center is the pearl of the city for glamorous buildings, mesmerizing big screens and neon lights.
Rich looking clean streets as if this district were immaculately clean. The truth is that is a way to give a false hope to corpo
slaves to get there. It's the propaganda of a success one can have living there in downtown apartments full of luxury. The market
district covers 20% of the whole city's territory. There the Government resides.
The rest 10% of the city's territory is lawfully being a part of the secret organization called THE NEW ORDER LODGE. The area is
fully secured and maintained by silent slaves made by orphans from slums and factory districts and then strictly training them
for their respective and needed tasks. Some are serving The Lodge's Nobility while others might stand as a bodyguarding units
and special assassination forces. There is no other information you might get since they secure themselves with a mystery.
Places like these are hidden from the public view so that you won't notice those places do exist, unless you will be lucky enough
to get there.

There is also an institution which is underestimated and mocked by people who notice their existence. That is THE HOLY CATHOLIC
CHURCH. Long story short. Around 300 years ago the church was firmly standing and guiding others to become saints and to
be blessed by THE HOLY TRINITY's mercy in order to have an everlasting life in heavens for all of the humankind. For that 
to happen the priests give the holy sacraments, with believers they pray the rosary, with them fast, with them they give help 
to those in need and they lecture others who are opened to them and they spread the gospel.
Under the church work guilds established in slums and in factory districts which work as a communion of the weak people who support
each other to defend against possible raids of hordes, bandits, and enterprises which work either by themselves or there is a bounty
put on a certain group. They concentrate themselves to grow in knowledge, train themselves to defend themselves and others,
create a cozy atmosphere where everyone will find a meaning in working on crops, cooking, raising animals for livestock usage,
chatting, building houses with anything possible and grow in faith. Faith is their core and through it they live in a virtue.
This alternative societal structure actually is tempting for all of the manipulated ones who have had enough of the tyranny of
democracy which works in a way that no matter who you choose you will choose a market card in the vote unless someone virtuous
stands up to sacrifice himself through that role he candidates for and you know him well.

That's the Strati via Igni city and it's colors. Your decisions made in-game will make you bear the responsibility through raiding
strongholds and other things that are within its gameplay. This game encourages people with wisdom, analitical thinking and
