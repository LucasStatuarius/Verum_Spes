The AFK mode will be made for both PCs and NPCs and its logic is simple.
- You are doing the job without distractions (no other activities are available
  when you are performing jobs which makes players focus on other matters such as
  doing homework in schools or cooking in the house)
- The job does make you grow in attributes stats which in turn make you advance
  in terms of finding more fitting jobs. The better your job is the better rewards
  are for them and the better you will grow in abilities.
- As you are getting used to work you are getting more capabilities to work longer
  and better.

AFK activities are divided on two forms:
 1. Personal work - You gain hard earned money as well as very useful resources
 2. Companion's work - Your companion takes all money (to buy necessities for survival)
                       however your companion gives you resources because he/she wants
                       to help you this way.

1. Personal work description:
   When you are clicking on the AFK mode page you are seeing the Personal work's tab,
   that's where you are seeing a stamina meter and attribute stats.
   
   Stamina meter is a vital thing you have to have it as high as necessary to work
   raid strongholds, perform duels and do other activities that might come up later.
   Every time you do perform work then stamina leaks away until you get exhausted.

   Stamina leaks basically throughout the time but to initiate the work you have to
   use it also to commence the task (likewise you are taking efforts to get into your
   workplace). That's why it's best to focus on work and do it once but for good.

   Attribute stats work as your score by which you can access jobs that are preferable
   for you. Just like in real life you need certain personal capabilities like intellect,
   vehemence, liveliness or swiftness at doing your jobs as expected.

   Every job will have its requirements via the list of stats that are minimum to perform
   this job well enough. The ratio between those stats can also suggest you the way of
   development for your stats since the highest stat requirement will give you the most
   stat development exp for its respective attribute.
